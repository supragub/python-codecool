Exercise:

Write a password generator in Python.
Be creative with how you generate passwords:
strong passwords have a mix of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
The passwords should be minimum 8 characters long, random, generating a new password every time the user asks for a new password.
Include your generator code in the "passwordgen" function.

Extra:

Ask the user how strong they want their password to be. For weak passwords, pick a word or two from a list.
