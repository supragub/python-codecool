# FIZZBUZZ

Write a program, that prints the numbers from 1 to 100.
Write a function called "fizzbuzz", which modifies the list of numbers as the following:
- for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number,
- and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”,
- for numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.


# LISTOVERLAP

Take two lists, say for example these two:

  a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
  b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]

Write a function called "listoverlap" that returns a list that contains only the elements that are common between the lists (without duplicates).
Make sure your program works on two lists of different sizes.

Extras:

1) Randomly generate two lists to test this
2) Write this in one line of Python


# PALINDROME

A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.

Write a function called "palindrome", which decides whether a string is a palindrome or not.
Ask the user for a string and print out the result.
Be aware of white spaces!


# PASSWORDGEN

Write a password generator in Python.
Be creative with how you generate passwords:
strong passwords have a mix of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
The passwords should be minimum 8 characters long, random, generating a new password every time the user asks for a new password.
Include your generator code in the "passwordgen" function.

Extra:

Ask the user how strong they want their password to be. For weak passwords, pick a word or two from a list.


# YEARS

Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age.
Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will turn 100 years old.
Write a function called "years", which contains the main logic: calculates the year from the age.

Extras:

1) Add on to the previous program by asking the user for another number and printing out that many copies of the previous message.
(Hint: order of operations exists in Python)

2) Print out that many copies of the previous message on separate lines.
(Hint: the string "\n is the same as pressing the ENTER button)
