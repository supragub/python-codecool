# codecool-python / 002-Calculator

A calculator script, that waits for the user to enter a number, then a sign (plus, minus, multiplication and division), then a number again. After the 2nd number input, the script should calculate the addition or subtraction and print it out. Then the program should run again with asking for the first number. The script should exit when the user enters a letter instead of a number.
